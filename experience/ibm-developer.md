Worked on an internal PaaS running on OpenShift and built with React.JS that serves over 11,000 highly available applications. Built and updated several Golang microservices to assist in the orchestration of user workloads, including an experimental PoC API that used read-replicas and circuit-breaker patterns to improve resiliency. Took part in a monitoring and observability initiative that introduced several integrations of external libraries into the platform and development environment. Added several full stack features, from SQL statement to React component to provide a better and more expansive experience for users.
