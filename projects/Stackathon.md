A web app that uses Google Maps API to move between locations creating stories and Indiana Jones style animations. Developed the full stack application alone in four days as part of a Hackathon style project. Frontend components include the map, input boxes, and story, while the backend utilizes a postgres database defined and accessed through Express and Sequelize.
